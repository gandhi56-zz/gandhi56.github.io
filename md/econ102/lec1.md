# Introduction to Macroeconomics

## Lecture 2

### Microeconomics review

- Scarcity and equilibrium are the fundamental problems of economics
- limited resources and unlimited wants
- market is always at equilibrium
- The Great depression in 1929, changed the way people see economy: people could not find jobs. Why not?
- John Maynard Keynes comes after the great depression and explains the great depression through his study of economics
- Performance of the economy when not in equilibrium
- Key term: interest

- Macroeconomics is about performance
  1. measurement: how to measure performance, quantitatively? ch7,8,10 are all about measurements (no perfect way to measure performance)
  2. policy: steps required to go from the current state to reach some goal, ch12,14 is about policy
  3. models: prove theoretically if the policy will work, before practically. (ch11)

* Macroeconomics is the study of the economy on a broad scale, focusing on issues such as economic growth, unemployment, and inflation.
  * working = producing a good or a service
  * we get income for working.
  * income value = value of the good/service produced
  * Define **GDP** as the sum of the market values of all final goods and services produced in a country within a given period of time.
  * Canada's GDP last year was $2M
  * World's largest economy: USA, USA's GDP is $20M
  * Conversion of foreign currency to USD (market value) affects GDP value.
  * G7 = group of 7 = world's largest economies
  * emerging economies = nations that are investing in more productive capacity
* Valuing an economy
  * Problems:
    1. How to add up unique goods and services into one measure of productivity?
    2. Not double counting intermediate goods and services that go into final goods and services
  * Refined definition: GDP is the sum of the market value ($) of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time.
  * But some units are not constant over time. CAD$20 is not the same as CAD$20 after a year.
  * Only count the final good and services. Intermediate goods are produced goods used by someone else to produce another good or service. Final goods and services are nonintermediate goods and services.
  * produced within a country, company producing a good/service in Canada counts towards Canada's GDP.
  * Given period of time: usually annual
* Production = expenditure = income
  * size of economy is referred to as either output or production
  * input --> production --> output

  * Problems with the above diagram:
    * Government intervention? Taxes?
    * Financial market? Eventually we earn more than our expenditure
    * World economy? This diagram does not consider international trade

## Lecture 3
* Problems with measuring GDP
  - How to include expenditure on 'soft' things like Amazon purchases and netflix services?
* Three ways to measure GDP:
  1. Expenditure approach: break expenditures down into four categories:
    ![alt text](2.png)
    - consumption (~55%): spending on goods and services by private individuals and households.
    - investment (~25): spending on productive inputs, such as factories, machinery, and inventory changes.
      - investing in businesses helps them with increment of their revenue
      - investment creates jobs
      - investments are policy-sensitive: what if there is an excess of output?
      - oil and gas companies are biggest drops in investments because prices are fairly stable
      - Moreover, government intervenes with oil and gas trades
      - high risk! businesses might be forced to terminate that project you invested in
    - Government purchases (~14%): spending on goods and services by all levels of the government
      - includes heath services, education, national trade or any other services provided by the government
      - Federal and provincial governments are at the same level in Canada
      - Most taxes paid to the federal government, who provides the most services?
      - __Fiscal federalism__
      - Employment Insurance premiums go into general revenue
      - Breaking News: Justin Trudeau spent more than any other Canadian government ever!
    - Net exports (~1%)= exports - imports
      - A third of Canadian GDP comes from international trade, mainly USA
      - Canada imports more than exports
      - We buy oil at Western Canadian Select price
      - We follow WTO system when trading internationally
    - Expenditure = Consumption + investments + government spending + net export = production (Y = C + I + G + NX)

  2. Income approach: add up the income earned by everyone in a country.
    ![alt text](3.png)
    - includes wages earned by workers, interest earned on capital investments, rents earned on land, and profits earned by firms
    - I = wages + interest + rental income + profits

  3. Value-added approach: calculates the value that each transaction adds to the economy
    - each value added is the price of firm's output - cost of input
    - allows us to determine how much of the total amount paid was created at each step in the production process
    - helpful in avoiding double counting
    - calculates the resale of existing goods
  
* **Note:** Each approach gives us the same GDP value.

* Example:
  ![alt text](4.png)
  - Value added = price at output - price at immediate input

* Using GDP to compare economies
  * Dollar is not a good unit of measurement to compare economies.
  * Calculate the growth rate of GDP:
    - growth(x) = $\frac{x_t - x_{t-1}}{x_{t-1}} \times 100\% $
      where $x_{t-1}$ is the previous GDP and $x_t$ is the current GDP
    - rise in GDP is a function of output and prices
    - not reliable!
    
## Lecture 4
* stocks and bonds are not investments because nothing is produced! Hence, not part of GDP.
* **Inflation** drives up GDP.
* **Real GDP**: Goods and services are values at constant prices.
  * To calculate:
    * Select a base year to fix prices.
    * Multiply the quantity of each good in a given year by its base year price.
  * can be interpreted as the amount of rise in production in the given amount of time.

* **Nominal GDP**: Goods and services are values at current prices.
  * Multiply the quantity of each good in a given year by its price in that year.

  * Example 1
    ![](5.png)

  * Example 2
    ![](6.png)

* Trivially, if base year == current year then real GDP = nominal GDP.
* If prices increases then nominal GDP increases ???

* **GDP deflator**
    ![](7.png)
  * unitless, not a percentage either
  * provides the ratio between the base-year value of current output and the current-year value of current output
  * summarizes how prices have changes over a certain period.
  * inflation describes how fast the overall level of prices is changing.
  * inflation can be calculated by looking at the percentage change in the GDP deflator between any two years.
  * average is not a good indicator of the distribution of GDP, specially over a long period.
  * Example 1
    ![](8.png)
  * Example 2
    ![](9.png)
* Recall: GDP is used to compare economies to measure how we are doing compared to other countries
* Still a problem: GDP does not consider population!
* GDP per capita = GDP/population
  * suggests a lot about differences in life and well-being between countries.
  * does not provide information about the distribution of income or the cost of living within a country.
  * Even though GDP is low, cost of living might be low for a country and poor families can still afford to make their living.
  * Hence, GDP per capita does not tell anything about cost of living. Cost of living varies depending on the place you live in within a country.
  * income may not be high but growth may still be high
  * does not consider how far a dollar goes in each country.
* Growth rates can track business cycles:
  * _Recession_ is a period of significant economic decline - negative GDP growth rate.
  * _Depression_ is a particularly severe or extended recession.
  * Growth is more rapid in developing nations.
  * High growth rate does not necessarily associate with high total GDP or GDP per capita.
  * Growth rates are calculated based on real GDP.
* Limitations of GDP measures:
  * GDP calculations do not consider home production, the underground economy and environmental externalities.
  * Green GDP is an alternative measure of GDP that subtracts the environmental costs of production from the positive outputs normally counted.
  * Another measurement: human development index
    * considers income, health and education
    * observes life expectancy, literacy rate
    * not better indicator since high income countries can afford better health care and better education
    * low life expectancy have lower income
    * higher life expectancy implies higher education implies higher income
    * That is, factors are correlated.

* Chapter 7 Summary
  * GDP is the most commonly used tools in macroeconomics to measure the size fo an economy.
  * GDP is the sum of the market values of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time.
  * Three approaches used to calculate GDP:
    * expenditure: classifies and adds up spending on all goods and services produced in an economy and subtracts spending on imports.
    * income: adds up income earned by everyone in a country.
    * value-added: accounts for the value that is added to the economy at each production stage.
  * GDP per capita allows comparisons over time and across countries.
  * However, it does not provide the full picture of an economy's health and quality of life.
  * Additionally, the overall price level can be calculated using nominal GDP and real GDP, called the GDP deflator.

* _Note: No formula sheet on exam!_
* _Note: Midterms contain 40 questions in an hour!_

### Chapter 8
* The cost of living
  * A large focus of macroeconomics is prices but more importantly how changes in prices impact our purchase power.
  * Prices change at different speeds across time and place.
  * Changing prices have effects on people's incentives and choices.
