### Properties of stars
* Stars form in great cloud of gas and dust, each one begins its life with roughly the same chemical composition as the sun
    * 75% hydrogen and 25% helium, no more than 2% of elements heavier than Helium
* Fundamental properties of stars: luminosity, surface temperature and mass
* How do we measure luminosity?
    * stars differ in brightness, but brightness depends on the distance of the star
    * **apparent brightness** = how bright stars look in our sky = amount of power reaching us (watts per unit square meter)
    * **luminosity** = total amount of power that a star emits into space (watts)
    * apparent brightness = luminosity / $$ (4 \pi \times distance^2) $$
    * we can measure a star's apparent brightness by using a detector that records how much energy strikes its light-sensitive surface each second. The only difficulties we face in measuring apparent brightness are making sure the detector is properly calibrated and, for ground-based telescopes, taking into account the absorption of light by Earth's atmosphere.
    * No detector can record light of all wavelengths.
    * total apparent brightness (luminosity) is the measurement across all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum.

* Measuring distance through stellar parallax
    * stellar parallax = small annual shifts in a star's apparent position caused by Earth's motion around the sun.
    * parallax angle = the angle of the shift.
    * By definition, the distance to an object with a parallax angle of 1 arcsecond is 1 parsec.
    
        $$ d = 1/p $$ where d is the distance to an object in parsecs and p is the parallax angle in arcseconds
    
    * a star's absolute magnitude  is the apparent magnitude it would have if it were at a distance of 10 parsecs from Earth.

* How do we measure stellar temperatures?
    * usually mean surface temperature as opposed to interior temperature
    * stars come in different color because they emit thermal radiation at various measures
    * can be determined by looking at the colour and how bright the star is
    * using spectroscopy

* How do we measure stellar masses?
    * using Newton's version of Kepler's third law
    * can only be applied to binary star systems because the law requires an object to be orbitting around another

* Types of binary star systems
    * **visual binary** is a pair of stars that we can see distinctly as the stars orbit each other.
    * **spectroscopic binary** is identified through observations of Doppler shifts in its spectral lines. If one star is orbitting another, it periodically moves towards and away from us causing the shift.
    * **eclipsing binary** is a pair of stars that orbit in the plane of our line of sight. When neither star is eclipsed, we see the combined light of both stars. When one star eclipses the other, the apparent brightness of the system drops because some of the light is blocked from our view.

* Measuring masses and radii in binary systems
    * apply Newton's version of Kepler's third law

### Patterns among stars
* Since colors tell us about surface temperature, there must be a relationship between surface temperature and luminosity.
* Hertzsprung - Russell diagram
    * horizontal axis represents stellar surface temperature which corresponds to spectral type. Temperature decreases from left to right because Hertzsprung and Russell based their diagrams on the spectral sequence OBAFGKM
    * vertical axis represents stellar luminosity, in units of the Sun's luminosity (L_sun). Stellar luminosities span a wide range, so we keep the graph compact by making each tick mark represent a luminosity 10 times as large as that of the prior tick mark.
