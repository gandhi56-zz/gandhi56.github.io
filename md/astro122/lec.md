### Properties of stars
* Stars form in great cloud of gas and dust, each one begins its life with roughly the same chemical composition as the sun
    * 75% hydrogen and 25% helium, no more than 2% of elements heavier than Helium
* Fundamental properties of stars: luminosity, surface temperature and mass
* How do we measure luminosity?
    * stars differ in brightness, but brightness depends on the distance of the star
    * **apparent brightness** = how bright stars look in our sky = amount of power reaching us (watts per unit square meter)
    * **luminosity** = total amount of power that a star emits into space (watts)
    * $$ apparent brightness = \frac{luminosity}{(4 \pi \times distance^2)} $$
    * we can measure a star's apparent brightness by using a detector that records how much energy strikes its light-sensitive surface each second. The only difficulties we face in measuring apparent brightness are making sure the detector is properly calibrated and, for ground-based telescopes, taking into account the absorption of light by Earth's atmosphere.
    * No detector can record light of all wavelengths.
    * total apparent brightness (luminosity) is the measurement across all wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum.

* Measuring distance through stellar parallax
    * stellar parallax = small annual shifts in a star's apparent position caused by Earth's motion around the sun.
    * parallax angle = the angle of the shift.
    * By definition, the distance to an object with a parallax angle of 1 arcsecond is 1 parsec.
    
        $$ d = 1/p $$ where d is the distance to an object in parsecs and p is the parallax angle in arcseconds
    
    * a star's absolute magnitude  is the apparent magnitude it would have if it were at a distance of 10 parsecs from Earth.

* How do we measure stellar temperatures?
    * usually mean surface temperature as opposed to interior temperature
    * stars come in different color because they emit thermal radiation at various measures
    * can be determined by looking at the colour and how bright the star is
    * using spectroscopy

* How do we measure stellar masses?
    * using Newton's version of Kepler's third law
    * can only be applied to binary star systems because the law requires an object to be orbitting around another

* Types of binary star systems
    * **visual binary** is a pair of stars that we can see distinctly as the stars orbit each other.
    * **spectroscopic binary** is identified through observations of Doppler shifts in its spectral lines. If one star is orbitting another, it periodically moves towards and away from us causing the shift.
    * **eclipsing binary** is a pair of stars that orbit in the plane of our line of sight. When neither star is eclipsed, we see the combined light of both stars. When one star eclipses the other, the apparent brightness of the system drops because some of the light is blocked from our view.

* Measuring masses and radii in binary systems
    * apply Newton's version of Kepler's third law

### Patterns among stars
* Since colors tell us about surface temperature, there must be a relationship between surface temperature and luminosity.
* Hertzsprung - Russell diagram
    * horizontal axis represents stellar surface temperature which corresponds to spectral type. Temperature decreases from left to right because Hertzsprung and Russell based their diagrams on the spectral sequence OBAFGKM
    * vertical axis represents stellar luminosity, in units of the Sun's luminosity (L_sun). Stellar luminosities span a wide range, so we keep the graph compact by making each tick mark represent a luminosity 10 times as large as that of the prior tick mark.
    * each location in the diagram represents a unique combination of spectral type and luminosity.
    * Stars in the upper left are hot and luminous, stars near the upper right are cool and luminous, stars near lower right are cool and dim, and stars near the lower left are hot and dim.
    * provides stellar information about stellar radii, because a star's luminosity depends on both its surface temperature and its surface area or radius. If two stars have the same surface temperature, one can be more luminous than the other only if it is larger in size.
    * Stellar radii must therefore increase as we go from high temperature, low-luminosity corner on the lower left of the HR diagram to the low temperature, high luminosity corner on the upper right.
    * most stars, like our Sun, fall somewhere along the **main sequence**, the prominent streak running from the upper left to the lower right on the HR diagram.
    * the stars in the upper right are called **supergiants** because they are very large in addition to being very bright.
    * just below the supergiants are the **giants**, which are somewhat smaller in radius and lower in luminosity
    * stars in the lower left are small in radius and appear white in color because of their high temperatures, these are called **white dwarfs**.
    * Stellar luminosity classes

        |   Class   |   Description     |
        |-----------|-------------------|
        |      I    |   Supergiants     |
        |      II   |   Bright giants   |
        |      III  |   Giants          |
        |      IV   |   Subgiants       |
        |      V    |   Main-sequence   |

    * classes II and IV are intermediate classes
    * mass is the most important attribute of a hydrogen-fusing star. The reason is that mass determines the balancing point at which the energy released by hydrogen fusion in the core equals the energy lost from the star's surface.
    * In general, a very luminous star must be very large or have a very high surface temperature, or some combination of both.
    * Since mass, surface temperature and luminosity are all related; we can estimate a main sequence star's mass just by knowing its spectral type.
    * Lifetimes along the main sequence
        * massive stars near the upper end of the main sequence have shorter lives than less massive stars near the lower end.
        * lifetime depends on mass and luminosity
        * mass determines how much hydrogen fuel the star initially contains in its core.
        * luminosity determines how rapidly the star uses up its fuel.
    * Giants and supergiants
        * upper right of the main sequence in an HR diagram
        * larger in radius than the sun
        * star's surface temperature determines the amount of life it emits
        * eventually runs out of fuel
    * White dwarfs
        * a giant with a mass similar to that of our sun ultimately ejects its outer layers, leaving behind a dead core in which all nuclear fusion has ceased.
    * **pulsating variable star** alternately expands and contracts, causing the star to rise and fall in luminosity.

### Star clusters
* all stars in a cluster lie at about the same distance from Earth
* all the stars in a cluster formed at about the same time 
* Two types:
    1. modest-size open clusters
    2. globular clusters
* the two types differ in how densely packed the cluster is and their location and age.




## Chapter 16: Star birth

### Objectives
>1. Stellar nurseries
>2. Stages of star birth
>3. Masses of newborn stars

### Stellar nurseries
* using the technique of main sequence turnoff point to determine the ages of star clusters, we have found that the youngest clusters are always associated with dark clouds of gas and dust, indicating that these interstellar clouds are the birthplaces of stars.
* where do stars come from?
    * average of two to three stars are born somewhere in the Milky Way galaxy each year
    * black patches within the Milky Way are interstellar gas clouds that appear dark because they block our view of the stars behind them. These gas clouds provide the raw material for star formation.
    * interstellar medium
        * gas and dust in spaces between stars
        * composed mostly of hydrogen and helium
        * use spectroscopy to measure the abundances of the new elements that stars have added to the interstellar medium
        * cloud absorbs some of the star's light, leaving the absorption lines in the star's spectrum
    * star-forming clouds
        * stars are born in interstellar clouds that are particularly cold and dense, usually molecular clouds because they are cold enough and dense enough to allow atoms to combine into molecules.
        * typical temperature of a molecular cloud is between 10K and 30K, density around 300 molecules per cubic cm
    * interstellar dust
        * carbon, silicon, oxygen and iron found in tiny solid grains of dust
        * dust scatter or absorb virtually all the visible light that enters a molecular cloud, preventing us from seeing stars that lie behind it.
        * regions of the sky with molecular clouds look so black
        * stars seen near the edges of a molecular cloud appear redder than similar stars outside the cloud, a phenomenon known as **interstellar reddening**
        * interstellar reddening occurs as follows:
            * dust grains block shorter wavelength photons of visible light more easily than longer wavelength photons.
            * near the edges of a moleular cloud, where stars are only partially obscured, the blocking of blue light causes stars to appear redder than their true colors
