# Lec 2: a modern view of the universe
* what is our place in the universe
    * Earth
    * solar system (x $10^6$)
    * milky way (x $10^8$)
    * local group (x 30)
    * local supercluster (x 30)
    * universe (?)
* 1 AU = 150M km
* 1 LY = 1e16m
* farther we look in distance, further back we look in time
# lec 3
* geocentric model: Earth in center
    * retrograde loop
    ![](2.png)
* Copernican revolution
    * heliocentric model: sun in the center
* Kepler's laws
    * orbits are elliptical
    * planets moves faster when they are closer to the sun, slower as they move farther away from the sun
    * more distant planets orbit the sun at slower average speeds, obeying the precise mathematical relationship
        $p^2 = a^3$
        where $p$ is the orbital period in years and $a$ is the orbital semimajor axis in AU

# lec 4
* Galileo
    * problems with the Copernican model
        * if Earth moved, objects such as birds would be left behind
        * non-circular orbits contradicted the concept of heavens being perfect and non-changing
        * nobody had detected stellar parallax
    * his solutions
        * there is a concept of inertia
        * second objected defeated by observing a supernova
        * used his telescope to defeat the third objection
* angular momentum = mrv
* change in angular momentum = torque = Fr

# lec 5
* conservation of momentum, angular momentum and energy
* conservation of angular momentum: if no external net torque acting on a system, then total angular momentum is conserved
* implications of Newton's gravity
    * planets are not the only objects with elliptical orbits
    * ellipses are not the only possible orbital shapes
    * objects orbit their common centre of mass
    * orbital characteristics tell us the masses of distant objects
# lec 6
* Newton's law of gravitation can be used to infer masses if the orbital properties are known:
    * $p^{2} = \frac{4 \pi^{2} a^{3}}{G (M_{1} + M_{2})}$
* tides are caused by a deformation of the Earth due to the difference in gravitational attraction from the moon
    * two tidal bulges: as Earth rotates, each point on the surface experiences the bulges twice a day.
    * water responds to the surface deformation, creating tides.
    * the sun also creates tidal deformations on Earth but the force due to the moon is stronger

# lec 9
* Stefan-Boltmann law: each square meter of a hotter object's surface emits more light at all wavelengths
    * radiative power per unit area = $\sigma \times T^4$
* Wien's law: hotter objects emit photons with higher average energy
    * wavelength of peak emission: $\lambda_{max} = 3mmK / T$

## The sun
* gravitational contraction
    * gravitational energy is converted into heat, which is then radiated away in photons
    * star shrinks with time
* how did fusion in the sun start?
    * sun formed out of a molecular cloud, that underwent gravitational contraction until the center was hot enough
* equilibria in the sun
    * gravitational equilibrium: gravity is balanced by pressure forces
        * also called hydrostatic equilibrium
        * inward push of gravity is balanced by the outward push of pressure forces, provided by the hot gas
        * more pressure closer to the core
        * higher pressure is associated to higher temperature to allow fusion to take place in the sun's core
    * energy balance: energy production by nuclear reactions is balanced by energy lost in radiation from the surface
        * energy generated per unit time by fusion in the core is equal to the energy per unit time leaving the surface in the form of photons
* solar structure
    * total radiative power is called luminosity
    * effective temperature: $L_{sun} = 4 \pi R_{sun}^{2}\sigma T_{eff}^{4}$
    * most of the emitted radiation is in the visible range, with secondary contributions from the infrared, UV and X-rays

        ![](3.png)


    * visible surface is called the **photosphere**
        * most of the light escapes from here
        * **sunspots** are visible on the sun's photosphere
    * **chromosphere**, outside of photosphere
        * hotter than photosphere
        * emits most of the UV light
    * **corona**, outside of photosphere
        * very low density but very hot layer that emits most of the sun's x-rays
    * **convection zone**
        * in which material transports energy by boiling
    * **radiation zone**
        * in which energy is transported by photon diffusion
    * **core** comprises the innermost and hottest region, in which energy is produced
* nuclear fusion in the sun
    * in the core of the sun, nuclear fusion reactions generate energy by converting hydrgon into helium
    * require high temperatures in the core of the sun
    * if two protons come close enough to each other, they can be stuck together by the strong nuclear force.
    * primary reaction: proton-proton chain
        * two protons fuse to make a deuterium nucleus (1p and 1n) and emitting a positron and a neutrino, occurs twice
        * deuterium + proton --> nucleus of Heium-3 + gamma ray, occurs twice
        * two Helium-3 fuse to form Helium-4, releasing two excess protons in the process
    * positron annihilates with an electron which results in energy
    * neutrino leave the sun
* sun's stability: solar thermostat
    * sun burns hydrogen at a steady rate due to a natural feedback cycle:
        * increase in core temperature ==> increase in energy generation ==> increase in pressure and core expands ==> decreasing temperature ==> decreasing energy generation

        * less energy generated ==> less pressure ==> core shrinks ==> increase in temperature ==> increase in energy generation
    * PV = kNT
        * N = number of particles
        * k = ideal gas constant
* sun's stability: core contraction
    * since the time of its formation, luminosity, radius and effectiive temperature have increased
* energy transport in the sun
    * radiative diffusion: photons bouncing around
        * photons collide with electrons
        * distance between collisions is called the mean free path
        * random walk
    * convection: circulation of matter
        * at constant pressure, hotter material has lower density
        * bouyancy lists hotter material because of lower density
    * rising hotter material occupies a larger volume. After giving up heat it shrinks and sinks
    * convection takes over from radiative diffusion because at lower temperature, gas absorbs photons more efficiently, mean free path shrinks, and diffusion is even slower. Convection goes all the way up to the photosphere.

* solar interior
    * can be studied in three different ways:
        * constructing mathematical models
            * describe equilibria
            * input param: mass, composition, knowledge of gas properties, nuclear reactions, photon opacities
        * solar vibrations
            * measure doppler shifts from different portions of the surface
            * helioseismology
        * solar neutrinos
            * neutrinos interact weakly with matter and thus probe the solar core directly

* solar activity
    * sunspots
        * appear darker because they are cooler
        * colder because magnetic fields suppress convection in their proximity, so hot material cannot come up to the surface easily
    * solar flares
        * short intense bursts of high energy radiation and charged particles due to magnetic field
    * solar wind
        * some regions of the corona lack hot gas: these are called coronal holes
    * effect on earth
        * flares and solar transient phenomena eject large number of particles which travel in huge bubbles called coronal mass ejections
        * once particles reach Earth, they create geomagnetic storm in the magnetic field that surrounds the Earth. Some effects:
            * generation of aurorae
            * disruptions of radio communications
            * additional drag to satellites on low Earth orbits
* Variations in solar activity
    * average number of sunspots on the sun gradually rises and falls
        * ave len of cycle is 11 years, can vary between 7 to 15 years
        * this is called the solar cycle

## Fundamental properties of stars
* three fundamental properties:
    * luminosity
    * surface temperature
    * mass
* parallax
    * displacement of difference in the apparent position of an object viewed along two different lines of sight, and is measured by the angle or semi-angle of inclination between those two lines
* stellar parallax is the effect of parallax on distant stars
    * due to shift in a star's apparent position due to the orbit of the earth around the sun
    * 1 parsec = 1 pc = 3.26 ly
    * 1 pc is the distance a star is away from us if its parallax angle is 1"
    * d = 1/p, where d is the distance to the star and p is the parallax angle in seconds
* luminosity
    * total amount of power emitted by a star
    * apparent brightness is the amount of power per unit surface area measured at a certain distance
    * total power passing through any sphere around the source is the same, regardless of distance and energy is spread evenly over surface area of sphere
        * $A = 4 \pi d^2$
        * $d$ is the distance to the source
    * $L = 4 \pi d^2 b$
        * $L$ is the luminosity of the star
        * $d$ is the distance to the star
        * $b$ is the energy per unit area per second
* surface temperature
    * use spectroscopy
    * spectral classes (hot to cool): OBAFGKM, each letter corresponds to different temperature ranges
