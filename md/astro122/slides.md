# Lec 2: a modern view of the universe
* what is our place in the universe
    * Earth
    * solar system (x $10^6$)
    * milky way (x $10^8$)
    * local group (x 30)
    * local supercluster (x 30)
    * universe (?)
* 1 AU = 150M km
* 1 LY = 1e16m
* farther we look in distance, further back we look in time
# lec 3
* geocentric model: Earth in center
    * retrograde loop

* Copernican revolution
    * heliocentric model: sun in the center
* Kepler's laws
    * orbits are elliptical
    * planets moves faster when they are closer to the sun, slower as they move farther away from the sun
    * more distant planets orbit the sun at slower average speeds, obeying the precise mathematical relationship
        $p^2 = a^3$
        where $p$ is the orbital period in years and $a$ is the orbital semimajor axis in AU

# lec 4
* Galileo
    * problems with the Copernican model
        * if Earth moved, objects such as birds would be left behind
        * non-circular orbits contradicted the concept of heavens being perfect and non-changing
        * nobody had detected stellar parallax
    * his solutions
        * there is a concept of inertia
        * second objected defeated by observing a supernova
        * used his telescope to defeat the third objection
* angular momentum = mrv
* change in angular momentum = torque = Fr

# lec 5
* conservation of momentum, angular momentum and energy
* conservation of angular momentum: if no external net torque acting on a system, then total angular momentum is conserved
* implications of Newton's gravity
    * planets are not the only objects with elliptical orbits
    * ellipses are not the only possible orbital shapes
    * objects orbit their common centre of mass
    * orbital characteristics tell us the masses of distant objects
# lec 6
* Newton's law of gravitation can be used to infer masses if the orbital properties are known:
    * $p^{2} = \frac{4 \pi^{2} a^{3}}{G (M_{1} + M_{2})}$
* tides are caused by a deformation of the Earth due to the difference in gravitational attraction from the moon
    * two tidal bulges: as Earth rotates, each point on the surface experiences the bulges twice a day.
    * water responds to the surface deformation, creating tides.
    * the sun also creates tidal deformations on Earth but the force due to the moon is stronger
